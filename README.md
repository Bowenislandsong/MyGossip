From smartphones, IoTs for homes and smart cities, we generate enormous amounts of data while constantly accessing services on the internet. These cloud-enabled services often consider connected devices as edges and need them to be in sync. Therefore, we need ways to support distributed systems that are highly fault-tolerant and available while abiding limited connectivity and resources.

We introduce a distributed database that is adaptable to systems with low network bandwidth and node stability. By relaxing the consistency requirement of a database we support systems that look for eventual consistency. In this session, you will learn the basics of distributed systems, its design concerning the CAP theory, and a brave usage of recent reconciliation protocols that revolutionizes the fundamentals of traditional databases. With this work, we hope to inspire and enable similar approaches that effectively decentralize workloads and aggregate the results.
